## üåü Overview Framework

![PiSA-SR](figs/framework.png)


(a) Training procedure of PiSA-SR. During the training process, two LoRA modules are respectively optimized for pixel-level and semantic-level enhancement.

(b) Inference procedure of PiSA-SR. During the inference stage, users can use the default setting to reconstruct the high-quality image in one-step diffusion or adjust Œª<sub>pix</sub> and Œª<sub>sem</sub> to control the strengths of pixel-level and semantic-level enhancement.
## üòç Visual Results

</div>

By increasing the guidance scale Œª<sub>pix</sub> on the pixel-level LoRA module, the image degradations such as noise and compression artifacts can be gradually removed; however, a too-strong Œª<sub>pix</sub> will make the SR image over-smoothed. By increasing the guidance scale Œª<sub>sem</sub> on the semantic-level LoRA module, the SR images will have more semantic details; nonetheless, a too-high Œª<sub>sem</sub> will generate visual artifacts.
